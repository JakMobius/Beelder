//
// To clarify:
//
// There will be two types of permanent data buffers: per-file and per-project.
//
// The more effective way to store light data that we will have to access at least
// once per build is to store it on the per-project storage.
//
// The most effective way to store heavy data is per-file storage,
// especially if we won't always need it.
//
// The dependency tree should be stored in per-project storage since it's the first
// thing that should be analyzed when project is building
//
// Since bundler plugin may not change AST tree cache, it's necessary to
// save its original version. AST tree is heavy to store in memory and parse,
// but we won't always want to read it. (only when file has been modified or
// will be processed by some plugin)
//
// Even thou transformed code is huge, the file that stores it will not be much larger
// than the bundle file, and it's three times lighter than AST in average, so we will
// store it in per-project storage.
